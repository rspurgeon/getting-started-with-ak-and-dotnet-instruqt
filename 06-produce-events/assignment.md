We're ready to send and receive events to our Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud.

We can use the `dotnet run` command to execute our .NET application, specifiying the `producer.csproj` project and the `getting-started-cloud.properties` file we built a few steps back.

Run this command in the terminal:

```
dotnet run --project producer.csproj $(pwd)/getting-started-cloud.properties
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
Produced event to topic purchases: key = eabara     value = batteries
Produced event to topic purchases: key = jbernard   value = t-shirts
Produced event to topic purchases: key = jsmith     value = t-shirts
Produced event to topic purchases: key = jbernard   value = alarm clock
Produced event to topic purchases: key = sgarcia    value = book
Produced event to topic purchases: key = jsmith     value = batteries
Produced event to topic purchases: key = jsmith     value = gift card
Produced event to topic purchases: key = eabara     value = book
Produced event to topic purchases: key = eabara     value = gift card
Produced event to topic purchases: key = htanaka    value = batteries
10 messages were produced to topic purchases
```

Now you have events in your Kafka topic! Let's read them back out by clicking Check to move to the next exercise...
