Start Apache Kafka速 the easiest, fastest way possible using Confluent Cloud in this getting started guide for .NET clients.

If you do not already have an account, head over to the [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/) signup page and use the promo code `KAFKA101` for $101 of additional free usage.

We are going to need a Kafka Cluster for our client application to operate with. We can provision a cluster in a few ways, for this exercise we will provision one using the `confluent` CLI which is already installed for you here. Another option is to use the [Confluent Cloud web console](https://confluent.cloud/) which provides a point and click experience.

Developers love the command line, so let's focus there. First login to your account using the `confluent` CLI:

```
confluent login
```

Confluent Cloud allows for segmenting of resources using Environments. For example, an environment might be used to isolate `dev` resources from `prd`. We can use this feature to create a sandbox for our work in this exercise.  Create a new environment with:

```
confluent environment create getting-started-dotnet
```

You will see something similiar to:
```
+------------------+------------------------+
| Environment Name | getting-started-dotnet |
| ID               | env-yd9np              |
+------------------+------------------------+
```

Next, set the current environment context of the CLI by using the new environment (substituted your environment ID:

```
confluent environment use <environment-id>
```

Now, let's create a cluster. We are going to create a basic cluster which is perfect for development use-cases. See the [documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/cluster-types.html) for details on cluster types.  When creating the cluster you must specify a cloud provider and region, in this example we've choosen Google Cloud Platform (`gcp`) in the central US region (`us-central1`). Be sure to use the specific name `dotnet` for this exercise as it's validated by this course system:

```
confluent kafka cluster create --cloud gcp --region us-central1 dotnet
```

You will quickly receive a report with important details about your new cluster, similiar to this:

```
It may take up to 5 minutes for the Kafka cluster to be ready.

| Status       | UP                                                        |

| RestEndpoint | https://pkc-43n10.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:443     |
+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

Similar to the new environment, let's set the new Kafka cluster as the current cluster context in the CLI which will make working w/ the new cluster easier in subsequent steps (be sure to use your cluster Id in the following command):

```
confluent kafka cluster use <cluster-id>
```

Great, we have a cluster! This exercise module will verify that your cluster is created before moving to the next step where we will begin to build our .NET applications.
