To start, open the IDE tab and open the `producer.cs` file.

The first line to study is near the top where we construct a `configuration` object from a file path passed in as a command line argument.

```
IConfiguration configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .AddIniFile(args[0])
            .Build();
```

Next let's look at the construction of a producer. This line passes the `configuration` instance into the `ProducerBuilder`. The type definition of the `ProducerBuilder` defines what type of events can be produced by this `producer` instance.

```
using (var producer = new ProducerBuilder<string, string>(
            configuration.AsEnumerable()).Build())
```

Finally let's look at the code which actually produces the event:

```
producer.Produce(topic, new Message<string, string> { Key = user, Value = item },
  ...
```

Here, the `producer` instance is instructed to send a new event with a key and a value specified int he function paramters to `Produce`.

To compile and verify this code, open the Terminal tab and run the following `dotnet` command:

```
dotnet build producer.csproj
```
