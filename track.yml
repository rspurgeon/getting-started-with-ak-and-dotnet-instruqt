title: Getting Started with Apache Kafka® and .NET
teaser: Step-by-step guide to building a .NET client application for Kafka
description: |-
  In this tutorial, you will build C# client applications which produce and consume messages from Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud.

  If you do not already have an account, be sure to [sign up](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/). New signups receive $400 to spend within Confluent Cloud during their first 60 days.

  *Note*: This tutorial focuses on a simple application to get you started. If you want to build more complex applications and microservices for data in motion—with powerful features such as real-time joins, aggregations, filters, exactly-once processing, and more—check out the [Kafka Streams 101 course](https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/kafka-streams/get-started/), which covers the Kafka Streams client library on [Confluent Developer](https://developer.confluent.io/)
